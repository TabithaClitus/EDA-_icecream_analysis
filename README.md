# EDA-_icecream_analysis
Kelly’s Ice Cream Data Analysis
This project analyzes a fictional ice cream store’s transaction data using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SymPy.
It covers:

Data Understanding & Cleaning → loading CSV, checking structure, missing values, duplicates, and summary stats.

EDA → transaction counts, identifying 3rd purchases (with a 33% discount), and visualizing purchase & discount distributions.

Statistics & Probability → calculating averages, discount impact, and probabilities of discounted transactions.

Linear Algebra → computing discounts using vectors, dot products, and weighted sums.

Calculus → finding and interpreting the derivative of the discount model.

Feature Engineering → creating transaction rank, discount flags, discounted amounts, and savings.

SQL Simulation → filtering, selecting, and sorting data with Pandas methods.

Insights → identifying top savers, total discounts given, and high-spending customers after discounts.
